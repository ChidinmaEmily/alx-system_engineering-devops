Web Stack Debugging Project 
Incident Summary:
On 11th August 2023, an incident occurred during the execution of the web stack debugging project. The project aimed to identify and resolve performance issues within the web application's stack to improve overall system stability and user experience. 
This post-mortem report aims to analyze the incident, its impact, root causes, and the lessons learned.

Incident Details:
During the web stack debugging project, the following issues were encountered:

Slow Page Load Times: Users reported significant delays in page load times, resulting in a poor user experience.
Frequent Server Crashes: The web application experienced unexpected server crashes, leading to downtime and service interruptions.
Memory Leaks: The system exhibited memory leaks, causing memory consumption to increase over time.
Impact:
The incident had several adverse effects, including:

Decreased User Satisfaction: Slow page load times negatively impacted user satisfaction and engagement.
Downtime and Unavailability: Frequent server crashes resulted in periods of system unavailability.
Reduced Performance: Memory leaks led to degradation in system performance and increased resource usage.
Root Causes:
The investigation identified the following root causes for the incident:

Inefficient Database Queries: Poorly optimized database queries resulted in slow page load times and increased server load.
Lack of Resource Monitoring: Insufficient monitoring of system resources contributed to memory leaks and server crashes.
Code Quality Issues: Unoptimized code structures and lack of proper error handling exacerbated performance problems.
Mitigation and Resolution:
To address the issues and prevent future incidents, the following actions were taken:

Database Query Optimization: Database queries were reviewed and optimized to reduce page load times and enhance overall system performance.
Resource Monitoring Implementation: Robust resource monitoring tools were implemented to promptly identify and address memory leaks and other performance-related issues.
Code Refactoring: The codebase underwent refactoring to improve efficiency, error handling, and overall system stability.
Lessons Learned:

Proactive Monitoring: Implement comprehensive monitoring tools to detect issues early and prevent their escalation.
Code Optimization: Regularly review and optimize code to ensure efficient resource usage and improve system performance.
User-Centric Approach: Prioritize user experience by focusing on reducing page load times and addressing performance bottlenecks.
Recommendations:

Conduct Regular Audits: Perform regular code and performance audits to identify and address potential issues before they impact users.

Training and Skill Development: Ensure team members are well-versed in debugging techniques and performance optimization strategies.
Continuous Improvement: Establish a culture of continuous improvement by learning from incidents and applying lessons to future projects.
Conclusion:
The web stack debugging project incident highlighted the importance of proactive monitoring, code optimization, and a user-centric approach. By addressing the root causes and implementing recommended actions, the project not only resolved immediate issues but also laid the foundation for a more stable and performant web application.
